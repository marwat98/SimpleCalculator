# A SIMPLE CALCULATOR BASED ON THE LINUX OPERATING SYSTEM CALCULATOR 

## A fully functional simple calculator project written in JavaScript, modeled after the Linux calculator

This project is an example of how to create a simple JavaScript calculator. The code has been fully tested using the node.js "jest" library. 
It has been checked whether the program displays mathematical operations, whether it performs mathematical operations using the math.evaluate function,
and whether it calculates every available function in the calculator.

## If you want to check the principle of the calculator, execute the following functions:
* Download all files in repository
* Open file index.html

## REMEMBER THAT ALL FILES MUST BE IN THE SAME FOLDER OTHERWISE PROGRAM CAN'T WILL NOT WORK !!!!!!!
